# MIT OCW

[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) is a wonderful collection of educational resources available publicly for free.  Plenty of the [mathematics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/) and [computer science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/) course materials include full videos of lectures and recitation sessions, lecture notes, homework problems (with solutions), and old exams.  I have met plenty of people that have not heard about it, so I figured I would make note of it here.
