# About

Hello!  My name is Chris.  I write software and occasionally write things here.  Currently I work mostly with cloud technologies (AWS + Terraform).  You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/cg-dv/) or [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-gilmartin-58a499229).

This site was created with the web framework [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is styled with the [Etch](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/etch/) theme.
