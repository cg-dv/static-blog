# Richard Hamming - You and Your Research 

One of my favorite talks is one given by Richard Hamming (1915 - 1998).

A PDF transcript of the talk can be found [here](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.pdf), and a video of the talk being delivered by Richard Hamming can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw).
