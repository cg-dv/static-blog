# Welcome

This blog was created to test how well a static site generated with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework would work when hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).  The other posts on this blog were included with the [Etch](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/etch/) theme, and they illustrate how various [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) text elements are rendered with the framework.
