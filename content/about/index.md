# About

Hello!  My name is Chris.  I write software and occasionally write things here.  Currently I work mostly with cloud technologies ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) + [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)).  

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/cg-dv/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-gilmartin-58a499229).
